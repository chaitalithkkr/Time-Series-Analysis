# Time-Series-Analysis

This repository contains regular implementations of time series analysis concepts using R, based on the Time Series Analysis book by Jonathan Cryer. The goal is to explore and apply fundamental concepts of stochastic processes, stationarity, autocorrelation, and other time series techniques step by step. The project will be continuously updated with various models and methods in time series forecasting.

## Overview
Time series analysis involves understanding and modeling data points collected or recorded at specific time intervals. This repository will include implementations of basic to advanced time series techniques, with a focus on understanding underlying patterns, such as trends, seasonality, and autocorrelation, inspired by the methodologies in Jonathan Cryerâ€™s book.

## Concepts and Methods Covered

## Dataset Used
Airline Passengers Dataset: Monthly total international airline passengers from January 1960 to December 1971. This dataset is used for illustrating and implementing various time series analysis techniques.

## File Structure
data/: Contains the time series datasets used in the project.

scripts/: R scripts implementing time series analysis methods.

requirements.txt: The list of required R packages.
